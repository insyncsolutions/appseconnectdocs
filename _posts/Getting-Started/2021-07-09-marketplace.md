Time is directly proportional to money. The more you save time, it means the more you are saving money. When you can increase reusability of 
developed resources, you save time, which means you save money. 

The `APPSeCONNECT` Marketplace establishes a perfect platform for showcasing the pre-built and time-tested packages giving the 3rd party 
developers a way to establish trust with their customers. The term marketplace is self-explanatory but in terms of our portal it provides 
the customer with a set of prepackaged process flows targeting a specific business problem. All the applications and packages are listed 
in the marketplace such that the packages become readily consumable by the customers. The marketplace also allows the citizen integrators 
to present their creations which customers can consume easily to save money. 

## MarketPlace Overview

A **Marketplace** is a platform where vendors can come together to sell their products or services to a curated customer base. The role of a marketplace owner is to bring together the right vendors and the right customers to drive sales through an 
exceptional multi-vendor platform - sellers have a place to gain visibility and enabling them to sell their products virtually. The marketplace owner, therefore, leaves the more operational side of the business to vendors while focusing mainly on 
promoting their marketplace brand with a view to driving traffic to the platform and converting site views into sales. 

Marketplace of an iPaaS is a place which advertises the pre-packaged integration such that people who are looking for 
similar kind of integrations can get access to them readily. In APPSeCONNECT, marketplace contains all your public 
packages which provides you with an advantage of re-usability. Any citizen integrator or developer can share/publish 
processflows in form of packages for performing free-flowing, smooth and seamless integration between various business 
applications. An approver after reviewing can approve or reject the packages. Moreover, marketplace also provides you with 
an additional feature of withdrawing and responding to a comment made by the approver.
