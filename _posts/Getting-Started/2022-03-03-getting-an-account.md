trial is for everyone who wants to try the platform before using it. The free trial is absolutely free which does not require any credit card linking

## Paid Trial

Unlike free trial, we also give you an option to request for Paid trial. As you know integration is a complex topic, and your systems are not exactly 
a vanilla system as you got it in first place. We generally do a lot of customizations and even we add more and more applications to the system. To adjust 
the iPaaS platform tailored for your application, you need certain adjustments on the integration. The Paid trail gives you access to our 
integration experts who will develop and adjust the integration based on the scope of work, and give a demo of the solution in liew of a small payment. 


 1. The process of getting paid request trial is similar to free request trial.
 2. Since it is a paid request where we will charge a nominal implementation cost but will implement integration based on visitors/customers customization.
