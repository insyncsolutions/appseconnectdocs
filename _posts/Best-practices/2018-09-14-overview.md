Getting started with APIs isnt always easy, there are tons of documents and techniques that can be used to leverage the idea of building your own
APIs. The API, how simple it is, requires a big amount of ground work so as to ensure the API is properly utilized 
and secured. The API needs to be properly organized, maintained and well documented, such that the API could be consumed correctly.
