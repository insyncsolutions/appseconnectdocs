Created or Edited processflows needs to be deployed to the environment in order to execute the integration process. 
Users, now need not have to update configuration every time for deploying every change made in the processflows. 
`DEPLOY` button enables the user to automatically deploy the changes in the environment as well as assign the 
credential for the applications that is used in the processflows.

## Prerequisites 

1)	Should have valid credentials for logging in to the APPSeCONNECT portal.

2)	[APPS](/processflow/processflow-app/) should be chosen from the apps section, for proceeding with the design of processflows.

3)	The [designed](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) processflow should be saved before deploying it to the environment.

4)  If you are deploying the processflow to the On-Premise environment, you need to check the `Enable Environment` checkbox in the Agent Settings as Active. 


## Deploying ProcessFlows to Environment

1)  Login to the portal and navigate to the **ProcessFlow** module available on the left menu. 

2)  Choose the processflow which is already designed and saved or you can [create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/).       

3)  Click on the `edit` button available for the selected processflow, which will navigate the user to the processflow Designing Page. Click on the `Deploy` button in the processflow Designing Page.  

![Deploy Processflow2](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-processflow2.png) 

4) The Deploy wizard opens on clicking the `Deploy` button. The deploy wizard is divided into several sections.

- **Select Environment :** You need to select the type of environment (Cloud or On-Premise) for deploying the processflow.
- **Set up Connection :** You need to select the credential for the applications selected in the processflow provided in the Agent.
- **Select lookups :** You need to fix up the lookups mapped for the attribute in the mapper node.
- **Sync & Retry :** You need to configure the Manual/Auto  & Retry execution of the processflow.

**Note : You can view some explained steps on the Right Side of the Deploy Wizard in the How it 
Works section, that will also help you deploy your processflow successfully.**

![Deploy Processflow11](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-processflow11.png)

**Note :** 

- **Here, the lookup is implemented for City, therefore we select the table city for fixing the lookup mapping.** 
- **You can select only one table at a time.**

(c) Click on the Done button. The lookup gets mapped into the corrosponding attributes of the applications.

![Deploy Processflow12](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-processflow12.png)


(d) The screen navigates to the Sync and Retry section of the deploy wizard after clicking on the NEXT button.

### Sync and Retry : On Premise

This section enables you to configure your processflow Sync and Re-try either in **auto mode** or **manual mode** before 
execution of the processflow here. By default, the sync type toggle button is selected in Manual Mode. 

The below steps are same, if you are deploying your processflow on your **HOSTED** environment.

![Deploy Processflow13](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-processflow13.png)

#### Process to configure Sync Process - Manual Mode
By toggling the **Select Sync** Toggle to Manual, your processflow will be configured to manual mode of execution. You will not have to configure any details for manual mode of sync process.

#### Process to configure Sync Process - Auto Mode
Select Frequency - There are three Options to choose from-  Every Day, Minute & Hour             
(a) If the Frequency selected as `Everyday`, you need to provide Interval/Sync Daily 
as shown below : 

![Processflow Autosync1](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-autosync1.png)  

(b) If frequency selected as Minute, you can provide input (Only 1-59). You can select End Execution or Never.If you select End Execution, Execution of a process 
flow will stop auto-sync after ‘N’ number of occurrences.    
If your selected option is **NEVER**, processflow will never stop execution.    
![Processflow Autosync2](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-autosync2.png)  

(c) If frequency selected as Hour, you can provide input (Only 1-23). You can select 
End Execution or Never. If you select End Execution, Execution of a process 
flow will stop auto-sync after ‘N’ number of occurrences.    
If your selected option is **Never**, processflow will never stop execution.
![Processflow Autosync3](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/processflow-autosync3.png)



#### Process to configure Retry - Auto & Manual
Retry setting can also be configured either in AUTO Mode or MANUAL mode. Enabling the Toggle button to **Manual** will allow the user to perform RETRY manually.
To know more about configuring RETRY in AUTO mode, navigate to the [Sync & Retry section](/processflow/retry-processflow/) of deploy wizard. 

(a) After configuring, click Finish button. The Tracker Window opens and you can view these messages processflow Publish Started, processflow Publish Completed, 
Downloading processflow Data, Downloading XSLT Files, Deployed etc.  

![Deploy Processflow14](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-processflow14.png)

(b) Once deployed, click on the Execute button in the processflow Designer page of the processflow.  Following the above steps, you can successfully Deploy and Execute a processflow.   

## Executing Deployed processflow
Execution of a processflow is a vital process for transforming data from one application to another. The basic prerequisites for executing a processflow is given below.

* You need to create a processflow. Steps to create a processflow is [given here](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/).
* You need to deploy the created processflow or an existing process that needs to be executed. Follow the above steps to know about the process of deploying.
* Environment should be active for the processflow to execute successfully.

### Steps to execute a processflow

1.	Once deployed, you need to click on the Execute button in the processflow Designer page.
![Deploy Tracker1](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-tracker1.png)  

2.	The tracker window opens on clicking the EXECUTE button. The Tracker window displays the node specific execution logs and messages as the processflows enters from one node to another.
![Deploy Tracker2](../../staticfiles/processflow/media/deploy-tracker2.png)  

3.	You can view each step of the operation. Nodes in the processflow will change its colour according to the operation. 
  * On-Going Operation : Yellow      
  * Failed Operation : Red       
  * Successful Operation : Green  
  
 **Note : You can [view the node specific snapshot](/processflow/snapshot-processflow/) for the processflow results.**    

## Deployed processflows in Environment

1.	Navigate to the [Environment section](/deployment/Environment-Management/) in the portal & click on the active environment. Click on the ProcessFlows tab in the Environment Details Page. You can view all the processflow those are deployed on that environment.
The following are the details that will displayed for deployed processflows.    
a.	Name of the processflow  
b.	Description of the processflow    
c.	Version of the processflow  
d.	The time of Deployment    
e.	Actions
