Processflows are the diagrammatic and visual representation of a business process. As an organization user, you can have a number of business processes which you need to perform your daily activities. The [processflow Home](/processflow/processflow-listing-page/) page will allow you to search, filter, create, edit and delete processflows. 
By reading this document an implementer would be able to design the first processflow for an organization and will execute it from the web portal also. 

To know in details, go through the given sections :
