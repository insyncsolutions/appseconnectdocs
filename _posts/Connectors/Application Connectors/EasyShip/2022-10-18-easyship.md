## What is Easyship?

`Easyship` is a `cloud-based shipping platform` designed for global eCommerce. 
The all-in-one system provides users with tools to manage domestic and international shipping 
through more than 50+ couriers and shipping providers, including `DHL`, `UPS`, `USPS` and `FedEx`. 
Store sync integrations enable automatic updates of courier names and tracking number in eCommerce stores, 
and emailing of tracking information to customers. An eCommerce checkout plugin provides customers 
with real-time shipping rate calculations, which include any taxes and customs duties to be paid. 
Customs duties and taxes are calculated automatically for every country, with category-based calculations, 
automatic generation of tax documents, and the ability to decide whether the customer or seller will pay any applicable charges.   

### Key benefits of using Easyship

- `Easyship` offers a plugin which calculates shipping rates in real-time during the checkout process, 
providing customers with tailored shipping quotes using data from more than 250 shipping solutions.

- `Customs duties` and `taxes`, including `VAT` are automatically calculated for every country, 
with all tax documentation generated and users able to decide whether they or the customer will pay customs charges, 
taxes and duties.

- Store sync integrations enable automatic updates of courier names and tracking numbers in users’ eCommerce stores 
and order tracking emails can be sent out to customers automatically.

- The dashboard gives users visibility into shipping costs, delivery time, taxes and provides real-time tracking updates 
and notifications from all couriers.

- `Shipping rules` allows users to define rules for automatic courier selection based on `shipping destination`, 
`product type`, `item weight` and many more.      

However, application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application 
is `Easyship`, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent. Here you will find the detailed 
description on how to configure the agents in `OP` agent and `Cloud agnet` for `Easyship`.     

## Pre-requisites for Easyship Configuration 

1) Create a [developer account](https://app.easyship.com/signup) in `Easyship` with necessary credentials.       
2) [Click here](https://developers.easyship.com/v1.0/reference/introduction-1) to know the `authentication mechanism` and `APIs` of the application along with their structures.       
3) `Email ID` and `Password` of `Easyship` application to login successfully.          
4) Access Token of the application to validate the credentials in the agent.    

### How to access Access Token?

1) Login to your `Easyship` account with valid credentials. From the dashboard, navigate to `Connect` -> Click on `New Integration`. 
You will land on the access token generation page. On clicking `API Integration`, a dialog box will appear. Select `I`m developing a custom integration` 
as `Integration Type`, provide a `Integration Name` and click on `Connect`. Your `Access Token` will be generated both for 
`Production` and `Sandbox` environment.

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent 

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration).    

### How to configure Easyship Application in OP Agent 

1) Create a [processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with `Easyship` as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.     
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.        
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.         

### Steps to configure the credentials in the OP agent 

1) Open the OP Agent by providing valid credentials.     
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the application `Easyship`. 
The credential panel opens for the application `Easyship`.       
![easyshipopagent1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/easyshipopagent1.png)
3)Provide the `Access Token` obtained from the appication dashboard.     
![easyshipopagent2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/easyshipopagent2.png)
4) Click on “Validate” button to validate the connection. A message `Successfully Validated` will appear 
if all the credentials provided by you for `Easyship` is valid. After validating the credentials, click “Save” button to save the credetials. 
Following the above processes, you can configure the `Easyship` application in the OP agent. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1** 

Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated but the 
processflows do not sync the data successfully. This basic issue resolves after removing the `Temp and Cache` files from the 
portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing the Temp and Cache files, again `deploy and execute` your processflow.  

**ISSUE 2**

User validation may fail due to invaild `Access Token`. Check the credentials once again and re-Validate the credentials. 

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to an API in `Easyship`, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of `Easyship`. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need 
to define Schemas and Actions. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here is the 
list of some of the `pre-packaged API` actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integration.

>Click here [Easyship](https://developers.easyship.com/reference/authentication-1) to know the authuorization and APIs details. 

|Endpoint|Action|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Path|
|---|---|---|----|------|----|
|/v2/shipments|shipments|GET|shipments|List all shipments|[shipments](https://developers.easyship.com/reference/get-shipments)| 
|/v2/shipments|shipments|POST|shipments|Create a Shipment|[shipments](https://developers.easyship.com/reference/create-a-shipment)|

|/v2/rates|rates|POST|rates|Request Rates|[rates](https://developers.easyship.com/reference/request-rates-and-taxes)|

### Action Filter Implementation 

Data is fetched from source application using APIs, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add these parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 

- General filters : It represents the overall filter criteria of the API. To define such filters, 
you do not need to specify anything special, just putting the field name and the value with the condition type is fine.

Let us consider any API of `Easyship` such as `shipments`.

```
Mostly, while retrieving data from the application, you will be 
using the following as the `key-value` pairs. 
Use `easyship_shipment_id` as the key and provide any numerical value such as `ESIN113070772`, `ESIN113071892` in the value field representing the item to be fetched. 
You can also fetch data 
as per the time instance using `created_at` as the key and `~{CreatedDate}~` as the value.
