Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. 
If your chosen application is SAP ECC, credentials need to be provided for 
validating the agent. Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the 
application SAP ECC, attributes, action and the Troubleshooting issues.

SAP ECC stands for SAP ERP central component. This central component integrates digital information from all of the 
various areas of an organization in real-time, so decision-makers can get a holistic view of the entire organization’s 
operations and make decisions based on this information. For example, if there is a sale made in one area of the 
business, SAP ECC updates the data in all other affected areas of the business, such as inventory and materials.

**Note : This document is for SAP ECC in On-Premise Agent only.**

## Pre-requisites for SAP ECC  Configuration 

1. Create an account in SAP ECC and Login into it. 
2. **Username** and **Password** to access the application. 
3. **Server Host**, **System Number**, **System ID**, **SAP Client ID** and **SAP Language**.

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the SAP ECC Application in the Agent

1. [Create a triggered processflow](/processflow/trigger-processflow/) with SAP ECC as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2. Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3. Move into the  App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.  

### Steps to Configure the credentials in the Agent 

1) Open APPSeCONNECT Agent by providing correct credentials.

2) In the **Apps Configurational panel** of the agent, you will be able to view the SAP ECC application. Click on the `+` icon to add the credential. 

3) Provide the credentials of SAP ECC application.
![sapbecc_1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapecc1.png)

4) After providing all the credentials. Click "Save" button. 
A message "Connection Data Saved" will appear if all the credentials provided by you for SAP ECC is valid.

5) Click on the "Validate" button, to validate the connection. 
A message "Test Connection Successful" will appear if all the credentials provided by you for SAP ECC is valid. 
In this way, you can configure the credentials of SAP ECC. 

## Troubleshooting

**Issue 1 : Source Application Data Not Found even if Data is present is the Source Application**

Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is 
accurately validated, the processflows do not sync. This basic issue resolves after removing 
the `Temp and Cache files` from the `portal` and from your `system`. Therefore after clearing all
this, you need to re-deploy and execute the processflow again.

For Example, if the "Source Application Data Not Found" in the log file appears, the probable cause is due 
to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files. 

**Issue 2 :** In SAP , we use various tables to store data related to product, order, inventory etc. If any error arises, you need to check 
the field mapping settings for the selected ECC condition tables. 

## Understanding IDOCS

`SAP IDOC` or Intermediate documents are an object that transports business transaction data in the form of an electronic message from one system to another. IDOC is an acronym for Intermediate Document. 
IDOCs or Intermediate Documents are commonly used in case of data migration between SAP systems or between SAP and legacy system or vice versa. 
Here the steps involved in configuring a new IDOC will be provided along with various transactions that are used while working with IDOCs. 
IDOCs can be classified into two types as `Inbound IDOCs` and `Outbound IDOCs`. 

- **Inbound IDOC :** These are IDOCs which get the data into SAP system from external source i.e any SAP system  or any other external system. 
- **Outbound IDOC :** These are IDOCs which are sent out from SAP system to any other system. i.e any SAP system or any other external system. 

These IDOCs contain information related to master data like customers, materials etc. as well as transaction information like Orders, Delivery, Invoice etc. 
Each master and transaction data has attributes of its own. Below are main IDOC types​ 

- ORDR (Order)​
- DESADV (Delivery)​
- INVOIC (Invoice)​
- MATMAS (material master)​
- DEBMAS (customer master)

`SAP IDOC` structure is divided into `Control Record`, `Data Records` and `Status records`. 
These records are stored in the transparent tables in SAP. These are EDIDC, EDID4 and EDIDS respectively. 
![sapecc_idoc1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapecc_idoc1.png)

#### CONTROL RECORD

It contains information such as IDoc number, direction, IDoc Status, Basic Type, Message Type, 
Partner (Sender/Receiver), date and time of creation/update, Interchange File or ISA number,etc. 
This `control record` section also provides you with four tabs `Type info`, `Partner`, 
`Technical info`, `Addresinfo` and `Details`. Each of these tabs has different functionalities. 

![sapecc_idoc2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapecc_idoc2.png) 

- `Type info` tabs contains information regarding Basic Type, Extension, Message Type, and Message Function. 
- `Partner` tabs will provide you with both `sender` and `receiver` information. 

![sapecc_idoc3](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapecc_idoc3.png) 

`Technical info` tabs will provide you `SAP Release`, `Time of creation` and `Last database update` informations. 

#### DATA RECORD

It contains the details of the IDoc segments. In data record section, you will view various segments in which 
the details corrosponding to the data being transffered will be stored. Suppose `HR master data` of an employee 
is being processed from a SAP system to another SAP or a non-SAP system, then the details of each employee will 
be stored in various fields as a segment under `data record`.
![sapecc_idoc4](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapecc_idoc4.png) 

Click on any segment and IDoc segment will open up displaying various fields along with the data that needs to be processed. 
![sapecc_idoc5](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapecc_idoc5.png) 

#### STATUS RECORDS

IDoc Status defines the processing status of the IDoc. IDoc statuses are used to track the IDoc and its various 
processing states. Status Numbers represents IDoc status. Current status of the IDoc is present in Control record. 

![sapecc_idoc6](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapecc_idoc6.png) 

Initial Status numbers are 64 for inbound and 03 for outbound. Successful status is 53 for inbound and 16 for outbound IDocs.

### Advantage of IDOCs​

- Reduces manual work by automating data exchange​.
- Supports ANSI and EDIFACT standards and make integration simple​.
- Can support real time data transfer​. 

### Steps to configure IDOC

### Output Types 

Using SAP script, you can configure different output types like a printed form that you need for internal use or 
an email message sent via email. You can also get output types in PDF format or any other required format. You can use 
different output types like printing a form, where you select output type Print Out, the document is printed. 
All the output types are stored in NAST table. To see the configured output type, you can use Transaction code – NACE. 

You need to follow the below steps to create or edit the output types.

- Navigate to V/40. Enter transaction V/40 in the command field and hit Enter. A `Output Control` window will appears. 
In the `Output Control` window, you have to select Application type as V1 for SALES, V3 for BILLING, E1 for Inbound Delivery, etc. 
Here, we have selected `V3` as the application type. After selecting the application type, click on `Output Types` button available in the 
menu panel of the `Output Control` window. A window will display different `Output Types` under this application. 
![sapoutputtype_1.png](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapoutputtype_1.png) 

- Select `Output Types` as `ZRD1` from the above window. Enter the `Access Sequence`.
![sapoutputtype_2.png](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/sapoutputtype_2.png) 

- Save the output type and it may prompt you save multiple the changes in a customizing transport.

**Note : Simply design the processflow, configure the agent and deploy the same to perform required integration.**
