`Slack` is a messaging app for business that connects people to the information that they need 
by bringing people together to work as one unified team. `Slack` transforms the way that organisations communicate.

## Benefits of Slack 

**Stay Connected** - `Slack` makes it easy to contact your colleagues, you can message anyone inside or outside 
your organisation and collaborate just as you would in person. People can work in dedicated spaces called channels, 
which bring the right people and information together.  

**Flexible** - `Slack` supports asynchronous work. When work is organised in channels, you can access the information 
you need in your own time, regardless of your location, time zone or function. Ask questions, catch up with new developments 
and share updates without having to coordinate schedules.    

**Inclusive** - In `Slack`, everyone in an organisation has access to the same shared and searchable information. 
When teams work together in channels, information can be shared with everyone at once, helping teams to stay aligned and 
make decisions more quickly. 

As `APPSeCONNECT` is a Business Process Automation tool, this will allow you to develop and configure seamless integration between business applications. 
Therefore, application configuration is a fundamental activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is 
`Slack`, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent both in case of `OP` and `Cloud`. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agents for the application `Slack`, troubleshooting issues and its action filter. 

## Pre-requisites for Slack Configuration 

1) Create an admin account in [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace) as well as an [app](https://api.slack.com/apps).       
2) [Click here](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) to know the authentication mechanism and different APIs of the application along with their structures.       
3) You need to know `App ID`, `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.    
4) You need to add `Slack App` to any Slack channel as per your requirement.    

### How to get App ID, Client ID and Client Secret?

1) Open any `Slack app` that you have created valid login credentials.    
2) From `Basic Information` page of the app, you will be get App ID, Client ID and Client Secret. 

### How to add Slack App into any Slack channel?

Open any `Slack Channel` as per requirement, Naviagte to `Members` -> `Integrations` -> `Add Apps` -> `Search`. 
Inside the `search box`, find out the `APP` from where you need to send the notification to the respective `slack channel`.  

>You can add any `Slack APP` to multiple channels in which you want to get notified. 

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the Slack Application in OP Agent

1) [Create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) or a [triggered processflow](/processflow/trigger-processflow/) with Slack as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.    
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application. 

### Steps to Configure the credentials in OP Agent

1) Open the OP Agent by providing correct credentials.   
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the application slack. 
The credential panel opens for the application calendly.

3) Enter `App ID`, `Client ID` and `Client Secret` at the required place. 
![slack_opagent2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/slack_opagent2.png)

4) Click on the `Authorize` button, to validate the connection. 
After clicking `Authorize`, a pop-up browser will open where you need to provide the workspace name and click on `Continue`. 
![slack_opagent3](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/slack_opagent3.png)

5) You will be re-directed to `slack log-in` page. Provide `email-id`, `password` and click on `Sign in`.
![slack_opagent4](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/slack_opagent4.png)
Click on `Allow`, to complete the configurations.  
![slack_opagent5](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/slack_opagent5.png)
After completing all the configurations, a success message in your OP agent home page will be displayed, with 
the credentials getting saved automatically. 

## Cloud Agent Configuration 

### Configure the Slack Application in Cloud Agent

1) Login to `APPSeCONNECT` portal with valid credentials.   

2) Navigate to **Manage > App**. Expand the slack application and click on `Credential`. 

3) Expand the `REST` node, click on `Add New Credential`.  

4) Provide the necessary information `Credential Name` only. The `Base Url` will be pre-written.  
![slack_cloud](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/slack_cloud.png)    

5) Click on `Grant`, to validate the connection. 
After clicking on `Grant`, a pop-up browser will open where you need to provide the workspace name and click on `Continue`. 
You will be re-directed to `slack log-in` page. Provide `email-id`, `password` and click on `Sign in`. 
Click on `Allow`, to complete the configurations. 
After completing all the configurations, a success message in your OP agent home page will be displayed, with 
the credentials getting saved automatically. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1**

While validating the credentials in the agent, sometimes the validation fails due to improper 
`Slack APP ID`, `Slack APP Client Id` and `Slack APP Client Secret`. 
Check the credentials once again and re-Authorize the credentials. 

**ISSUE 2**

Some of the basic troubleshooting issues happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, 
and if processflow don’t sync properly. This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the 
portal and from your system. Therefore after clearing all this, you need to deploy and excute the processflow again 
to perform the required business integration in a smooth and free-flowing way. For E.g. If the Source Application 
not Found in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files. 

## Action and its Attributes

While defining a connection to an API in Slack, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your Slack application. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need 
to define Schemas and Actions. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. 

While using slack as the destination application to notify the users about their requirement, 
you can inform them by sending message individually or through a channel. However, while using the same 
you need to use `chat` as the `schema` and `chat.postMessage` as the `action` in both the cases.  

## Action Filter Implementation

Data may be fetched/posted from source/destination application using `APIs`, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being used, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add these parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 

However, while posting data to the slack application from any source application using `APPSeCONNECT`, 
no longer you need to provide any action filter. Just mention the `channel name` and/or `user name` in mapping. 
Suppose you need to notify to any slack user, every week how many new customers are added in any E-Commerce application such as `Magento`. 
To handle this situation, you need to use `GetUserId` function and provide the email id of the user 
who will receive the notification in the slack.  
![slack_mappermessage](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/slack_mappermessage.png)  

You can also send similar notifications to any slack channel using the following configurations in the mapper node. 
Retrieve the `channelid` using `GetChannelId` and `type` as `section` along with the other mentioned specification.
