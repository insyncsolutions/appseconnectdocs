- **HR/Onboarding** - `DocuSign` helps HR teams provide a great onboarding experience, by streamlining the 
necessary paperwork and eliminating the need to sign and return stacks of hardcopy documents. 

As `APPSeCONNECT` is a Business Process Automation tool, this will allow you to develop and configure seamless integration between business applications. 
Therefore, application configuration is a fundamental activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is 
`DocuSign`, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent both in case of `OP` and `Cloud` agent. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agents for the application `DocuSign`, troubleshooting issues, action and its filters.  

## Pre-requisites for DocuSign Configuration 

1) Create a developer account in [DocuSign](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/?postActivateUrl=https://developers.docusign.com/&_gl=1*jocp05*_ga*Nzk1NzQ2NjU1LjE2NjUwMzI0NTc.*_ga_1TZ7S9D6BQ*MTY2NTExODc2NC42LjEuMTY2NTEyMDYwNS41MS4wLjA.&_ga=2.138398264.904475897.1665032457-795746655.1665032457) with necessary and essential credentials.     
2) You need to create an [App](https://admindemo.docusign.com/apps-and-keys) under `Apps and Keys` such that `Client ID` and `Client Secret` are available to you.    
3) [Click here](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/accounts/) to know the authentication mechanism and 
different APIs of the application along with their structures. 

### How to create an App and configure Redirect Url?

1) Login to `DocuSign` with valid credentials. While you are logged in, you will land onto 
the dashboard page.    
2) Navigate to `INTEGRATIONS` -> `Apps and Keys`.    
![docusign1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/docusign1.png)
3) On clicking `ADD APP AND INTEGRATIONS KEY`, a dialog box appears where you need to provide the `App Name`. Click on `CREATE APP`.     
4) From the App details page, navigate to `Authentication` and click on `ADD SECRET KEY`. A secret key will be generated and save it for future use.

5) Navigate to `Additional Settings` -> `Redirect URIs`. Use `https://portal.appseconnect.com` as the `Redirect URIs`.

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the DocuSign Application in OP Agent

1) [Create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with `DocuSign` as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application. 

### Steps to Configure the credentials in OP Agent

1) Open the OP Agent by providing valid credentials.   
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the application DocuSign. 
The credential panel opens for the application DocuSign. 
![docusignopagent1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/docusignopagent1.png) 
3) Enter `Outh Uri` as `https://account-d.docusign.com/oauth`, `Client Id`, `Client Secret` and `Scope`. 
Use `INTEGRATION KEY` as `Client ID` and `SECRET KEY` as `Client Secret`. 
![docusignopagent2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/docusignopagent2.png)
4) Click on the `Authorize` button, to validate the connection. 
After clicking `Authorize`, a pop-up browser will open re-directing you to `DocuSign` login page. 
Provide valid login credentials and click on `Login`. The validation starts immediately, and `Authorization Successful` will be displayed, if valid login credentials have been provided. 
Following the above processes, you can configure the DocuSign application in the OP agent. 

## Cloud Agent Configuration 

### Configure the DocuSign Application in Cloud Agent

1) Login to `APPSeCONNECT` portal with valid credentials.   

2) Navigate to **Manage > App**. Expand the `docusign` application and click on `Credential`. 

3) Expand the `REST` node, click on `Add New Credential`.  

4) Provide the necessary information `Outh Uri` as `https://account-d.docusign.com/oauth`, `Client Id`, `Client Secret` and `Scope`. 
Use `INTEGRATION KEY` as `Client ID` and `SECRET KEY` as `Client Secret`. 
![docusigncloud](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/docusigncloud.png)    

5) Click on `Grant`, to validate the connection. 
After clicking on `Grant`, a pop-up browser will open re-directing you to `DocuSign` login page. 
Provide valid login credentials and click on `Login`. The validation starts immediately, and `Authorization Successful` will be displayed, if valid login credentials have been provided. 
Following the above processes, you can configure the DocuSign application in the `Cloud` agent. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1** 

Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated but the 
processflows do not sync the data successfully. This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the 
portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing the Temp and Cache files, again deploy and execute your processflow.  

**ISSUE 2**

User validation may fail due to invaild `Outh Uri`, `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Scope`. Check the credentials once again and re-Validate the credentials. 

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to an API in `DocuSign`, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of `DocuSign`. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need 
to define Schemas and Actions. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here is the 
list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integration.

>Click here [DocuSign](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/accounts/) to know the authuorization and APIs details. 

|Endpoint|Action|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Path|
|---|---|---|---|------|-----|
|envelopes|envelopes|GET|envelopes|Retrieves the overall status for the specified envelope.|[envelopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/get/)| 
|envelopes|envelopes|POST|envelopes|Creates and sends an envelope or creates a draft envelope|[envelopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/)|

>Since, we are using a triggered processflow, no need to use any action filter.
