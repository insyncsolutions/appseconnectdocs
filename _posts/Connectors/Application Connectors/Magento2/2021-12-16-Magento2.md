Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. Magento is one of the ecommerce platform and to configure the agent provide `API Path`, `User name` and `Password`. 
Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the application Magento, 
the Integration Techniques and the Troubleshooting issues.   

## Pre-requisites for Magento  Configuration 

1. Create an account in Magento and Login into it. 
2. As Magento is a cloud-based application, therefore it can be accessed through URL. The API Path is your - `baseurl/rest/V1/`. 
3. **Username** and **Password** to access the application.  

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration).   

### Configuring the Magento Application in On-Premise Agent

1. Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.
2. [Create](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) and [Deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/#deploying-processflows-to-environment) ProcessFlows in the cloud portal.  
3. Move into the  App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.  
4. Enter the details - API Path, User Name and Password.   
5. Click Validate and Save.   

After validation, you will get the message **Validation passed, now you can save these details.**.

>Uncheck the **Show in Sync Panel** checkbox before proceeding with the App Configurations. 

## Steps to Configure Magento Credential in OP Agent with Access Token :

1. For generating the Integration Access token, login to the Magento Admin and Navigate to `System > Extensions > Integrations.`  
![magentoat2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat2.png)

2. Click on the `Add New Integration button`, in the Integration window.
![magentoat3](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat3.png)

3. Provide the **Name** (name of integration) and your current store **password** in the respective field.
![magentoat4](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat4.png)

4.	Click on the API tab and choose the Resource Access. You can select either of the two options provided, ALL & Custom. Once the resource access is provided, click on the SAVE button.

    a.	**ALL :** Selecting this will provide the access to all the resources of your Magento platform.

    b.	**Custom :** You can select only those resources for which you want to provide the resource access. You can select the modules from the tree provided below.
![magentoat5](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat5.png)

5. On saving, you can view a list menu, where you can view the name of the configuration you provided. Click on the **Activate** button available in the list menu.
![magentoat6](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat6.png)

6. Click on the **Allow** button to allow the generation of the tokens. You can view the generated tokens after clicking the allow button. 
![magentoat8](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat8.png)

7. In the App Configurational Panel of the agent, Click on the + button beside the app Magento.

8. You can view the fields for validating the Magento adapter. The following are the fields for validating the adapter.

    a.	**API Path :** You need to provide the Base URL of your Magento store admin. [Click Here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8094635/SVSLp7pE#a242ffbe-3639-45e0-b282-e14d316809c5) to know about the API Paths in Magento.  

    b.	**Integration Access Token :** The access token generated on your Magento store should be provided here.  
![magentoat1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat1.png)

9.	Copy the generated Access Token and paste it in the OP Agent. Click on the SAVE button, followed by VALIDATE. 
![magentoat9](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat9.png)

>It is mandatory to enable the checkbox for Integration Access Token, while validating the Provided Token. Working with Integration Access Token, you can skip providing the username and password as the token validates with the API link provided.

## Steps to Configure Magento Credential in OP Agent without Access Token

1. You can also validate the credentials by providing only the **API Path**, **Username** and **Password**.  
![magentoat10](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentoat10.png)  

Following either of the above steps you can successfully validate your Magento adapter using Integration Access Token or without using the same.  


## Cloud Agent Configuration 

### Configuring the Magento Application in Cloud Agent

1. Login to APPSeCONNECT portal with valid credentials.   

2. Navigate to **Manage > App**. Expand the magento application and click on `Credential`. 

3. Expand the `REST` node, click on `Add New Credential`.  

4. Provide the necessary information `Credential Name`, `Magento Url`, `User Name` and `Api Password`.  
![magentocloud1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/magentocloud1.png)    

5. Click on Save and a toaster message will be displayed confirming the same.

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1 :**

Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated but the processflows do not sync the data successfully. 
This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing the Temp and Cache files, again deploy and execute your processflow. 

For E.g. : If the `Source Application Not Found` appears in the log file, the probable cause is due to the presence of the Temp and Cache Files.  

**ISSUE 2 :**

**You have an API for Magento, but the API is not accessible from your server.**

* Discuss how to check API from local server.
* Discuss about firewall settings. 

**ISSUE 3 :**

**Customer Address issue with sourcelib: SetCustomerAddressItems(addresses) - Magento2-SAP.**

`SetCustomerAddressItems(addresses)` is creating an issue with customer address sync which has one address both as 
bill to and ship to set as default. Checking the SAP address push scenario, this function was developed. 
This function transforms extra node to push the address in ship to section of SAP. The structure is as below :

```xml
<item>
<default_shipping>true</default_shipping>,
<default_billing>true</default_billing>
</item>
```

After transform through `sourcelib:SetCustomerAddressItems (addresses)`

```xml
<item1>
<default_shipping>false</default_shipping>,
<default_billing>true</default_billing>
</item1>
<item2>
<default_shipping>true</default_shipping>
<default_billing>true</default_billing>
</item2>
```

This extra node is creating an issue in SAP with multiple Address Line which is not allowed and resulting in failure of the data. 

Solution : - Simple mapping should be done. No need to call the method `SetCustomerAddressItems()`. This method is developed only for SAP B1. 

**Protip:** While working with SAP B1 Integrations, SAP Business One DI Server ON/OFF is needed to be done for proper syncing if any errors like the above one persists.

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to a particular API endpoint in Magento, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your magento installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targetted for a particular endpoint while schema is the 
data needed to execute the API. Here are the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your 
integrations. 

|Endpoint|Action|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Help|
|---|---|---|---|------|-----|
|customers|POST.json|POST|customer|This will enable you to create a customer's account in Magento 2.|[Create Customers](https://www.mageplaza.com/devdocs/create-customer-magento-2.html#endpoint)|
|products|POST.json|POST|products|This will create products in Magento 2 from Source Application.|[product](https://www.mageplaza.com/devdocs/create-simple-products-magento-2-api.html#step-2)|  
|orders|orders|GET|order|Magento gives user the privelage to add Orders from the front end of the application as well as backend of the application.Login to Magento 2.0 front end with the valid credentials of a contact person.Now select certain items and place an order as per requirement. After the order is successfully placed the order ID should be generated. [This will get orders from Magento2 for posting in any destination application from the backend](https://docs.magento.com/m2/ce/user_guide/customers/customer-account-create-order.html)|[order](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/rest/tutorials/orders/order-create-order.html)|

|invoices|invoices|POST.json|invoice|This will provide you a confirmation that a purchase has been made and your customers also have all the information about what they have bought.|[invoice](https://www.mageplaza.com/devdocs/create-invoice-magento-2.html#view-invoice)|  

## Custom Filter implementation for Data fetch using Magento

API hits can be tammed using custom filters on its actions. You will be able to fetch specific data as per your filter. With APPSeCONNECT, you will have the option to implement custom 
Action Filters that will enable you to fetch specific data as required. You need to implement your filter on three specific areas including the data filter. The filter should be provided as per the same syntax provided in the images : `nf{searchCriteria[body]}nf`

1) Filter on Page Size : This is for implementing pagination for displaying maximum data on multiple pages as per your configuration. 
The number of pages required for implementing the pagination needs to be provided in the field `VALUE`.

![customfiltermage1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/customfiltermage1.png)

2) Filter on Field : This is for implementing and fetching the data as per the API request. This implements the API request for Magento2. The configuration **created_at** needs to be given the field `VALUE`

![customfiltermage2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/customfiltermage2.png)

3) Filter on Direction : This defines as how the data should be displayed in the bucket, **Ascending or  Descending**. For ascending, you need to implement `asc` in the field `value`. For descending, you need to implement `desc` in the field `value`.

![customfiltermage2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/customfiltermage3.png)

**Protip:** Working on SAP B1 and Magento 2 (B2C) needs a SAP B1 add-on and Magento B2C extension for its integration.
Customers and Orders can be created and placed from the Front-End also. 
For Placing orders from front end, visit the E-Commerce store and follow the generic steps for placing orders
and creating customers.
