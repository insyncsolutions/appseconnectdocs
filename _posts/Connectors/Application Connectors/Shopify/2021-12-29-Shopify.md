Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your choosen application is Shopify, such as generating the API key for Shopify, valid credentials need to be provided for validating the agent.

Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the application Shopify, its attributes and actions, 
and the Troubleshooting issues.

## Pre-requisites for Shopify  Configuration 

### Creation of Private APP is essential to generate the API Key

Steps for Creating Private APP and API KEY :

1) Login to your Shopify App and click on the Admin Panel.  
2) Login to your AEC Agent with the valid Credentials. To Know about Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/)    
3) Go to APPS > Develop Apps on your Shopify Dashboard.    
4) You will be directed to Private Apps Page.    
5) There will be an option **Create an APP**. Input details - Private app name and emergency developer email & Click Save.    
6) In the Admin Panel, the Credentials mainly the API Key, Password will get generated.    

## Configure the Shopify Application in the Agent

1) The API Key is now generated. Prior to Proceeding with the Integrations process, configure the AEC Agent.  
2) Create a processflow with Shopify as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise or Hosted Agent.  
3) Now in the **Apps Configurations** panel of the agent, configure Shopify with valid **API key, API Password and Base URL generated in Shopify API Manager.**  
4) After providing the necessary details, Click Validate and Save.  

These are some of the basic prerequisites that must be done before integrating any app with Shopify.

Note :
* As per the latest versioning of Shopify API, for validating the Base URL for your Shopify store in APPSeCONNECT Agent, 
  users/implementers need to add `admin/api/2019-10/` as the suffix to the URL .
* This update is available from the On-Premise Agent version 4.4.10.0 & above.
* The adapter version for the Shopify adapter should be 4.2.2.2.

## Integration Techniques

For Integration process, you need to execute the necessary processflows in your On-Premise agent or Cloud agent as required while syncing. 

1) For an Instance : Suppose you need to add customer created in shopify to any other application you need for business integration. 
   Therefore, a processflow containing the mapping with the necessary fields needs to be deployed and executed, for syncing the customer from Shopify to any other Application you are working with.

2) Integration of Shopify with SAP B1 requires some UDT, UDO & UDF's to be defined.

## Troubleshooting

Some of the basic troubleshooting issues happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, and if processflow don't sync properly. 
This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system. 
Therefore after clearing all this, you need to [deploy and excute](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow again to perform the required business integration in a smooth and free-flowing way. 
For E.g. If the `Source Application not Found` in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the 
Temp and Cache Files.

# Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to a particular API endpoint in Shopify, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your shopify installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT you need to define Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targetted for a particular 
endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here are the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.

visit the E-Commerce store and follow the generic steps for placing orders and creating customers, this one.

## Action Filter implementation for Data fetch using Shopify

Data is fetched from source application using APIs, and as you are aware of, API provides filters which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action defines the endpoint of the application, while the filters defines 
the search criteria of the data. You can refer to the following images and use them while fetching data from `Shopify`. 

1) In case of retrieving `Business Partner` from `Shopify` created after a specified date, use `created_at_min` as the key and `~{CreatedDate}~` as its filter. However, customers created before a specified date can also be fetched, by using `created_at_max` as the key and `~{CreatedDate}~` as its filter.

2) Use `status` as the key and `any` as its value, to fetch `A/R Invoice Add` and `Incoming Payment Add` from the source application.
![shopifyapp_2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopifyapp_2.png)

3) Use `updated_at_min` as the key and `~{CreatedDate}~` as its value, to fetch `Sales Order as Draft` from Shopify.
