Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is Shopify, credentials 
need to be provided for validating the agent.  Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the application
Shopify, Troubleshooting issues, the attributes and its action. 

Shopify is a complete ecommerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business. The adapter of the application Shopify provides 
the leverage to communicate and adapt with the AEC portal. This section provides you the detailed process of validating the credential of the 
application Shopify.

## Pre-requisites for Shopify  Configuration 

1. Create an account in Shopify and Login into it. 
2. **Username** and **Password** to access the application.  
3. [Click here](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest#endpoints) to know the endpoints of the application. 

### Creation of Private APP 

#### Steps for Creating Private APP and API KEY

1. Login to your Shopify Application.   
2. On the Admin Panel, follow the path `Settings -> Apps and sales channels -> Develop apps -> Create an app -> `. Provide the App name and developer email in the specified text box. Click on Create app.  
3. Newly created app will be displayed along with the app user email and its creation date. Follow the path `Configuration -> Admin API integration`. Check in all the check-box and click on `Save`. 
4. Move to API credentials and click on install. Your Access token, API Key and API Secret key will be generated.        

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the Shopify Application in the Agent

1. [Create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with Shopify as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2. Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3. Move into the  App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.  

### Steps to Configure Shopify Credential in OP Agent

1. In the App Configuration panel of the agent, click on the + button, beside the app Shopify.  
![shopify_1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopify_1.png)     
2. On clicking the + button, the credential panel opens for the application Shopify.   
![shopify_2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopify_2.png)
3. Provide the `Base URL`, `API Key` and `API Password` in the ageent.
4. After providing the credentials, click on `Validate` button. After the validating the credentials successfully, click on `SAVE`.  
![shopify_3](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopify_3.png)   

Following this process, the Shopify application can be configured in the OP agent.

Note :
* As per the latest versioning of Shopify API, for validating the Base URL for your Shopify store in APPSeCONNECT Agent, 
  users/implementers need to add `admin/api/2019-10/` as the suffix to the URL .
* This update is available from the On-Premise Agent version 4.4.10.0 & above.
* The adapter version for the Shopify adapter should be 4.2.2.2.

## Cloud Agent Configuration 

### Configuring the Shopify Application in Cloud Agent

1. Login to APPSeCONNECT portal with valid credentials.   

2. Navigate to **Manage > App**. Expand the Shopify application and click on `Credential`. 

3. Expand the `REST` node, click on `Add New Credential`.  

4. Provide the necessary information `Credential Name`, `Base URL`, `API Key` and `API Password`. `Secret Key` is an optioanl field.   
![shopify_cloud](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopify_cloud.png)    

5. Click on Save and a toaster message will be displayed confirming the same.

## Troubleshooting

Some of the basic troubleshooting issues happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, the processflow do not sync data properly. 
This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system. 
Therefore after clearing all this, you need to [deploy and excute](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow again to perform the required business integration in a smooth and free-flowing way. 
For E.g. If the `Source Application not Found` , remove the Temp and Cache Files. Again re-deploy and execute the processflow. 

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to a particular API endpoint in Shopify, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your shopify installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT you need to define Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targetted for a particular 
endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here are the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.

**Protip :** Customers and Orders can be created and placed from the Front-End also. For Placing orders from front end, 
visit the E-Commerce store and follow the generic steps for placing orders and creating customers, this one.

### Action Filter Implementation 

Data is fetched from source application using APIs, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add these parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 

- General filters : It represents the overall filter criteria of the API. To define such filters, you do not need to specify anything special, just putting the field name and the value with the condition type is fine.

Let us consider any API of shopify such as `customer`, the request structure will look like : 

```json

  ]
}
```

Since `shopify` is an ecommerce application, there can be huge number of customers created from `UI`of  the application and stored in respective databases. 
You can fetch these customers from multiple ones by applying filter on any of the above mentioned fields. While fetching the customers details, you need to mention the 
fields and their corresponding values as `key-value` pair in the action filter of every processflow. 

Suppose, you need to fetch two customer at a time from the application created on or before a specified date, then you need to mention 
**created\_at**, **~{CreatedDate}~** and **limit**, **2** as key and value respectively combined with the logical `&&` operator. 
`limit` is used to restrict the number of data fetched from the application. You can use `limit` with any other endpoints as well 
such as Order, Products etc.
![shopifyapp_5](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopifyapp_5.png) 

Similarly, to fetch `Sales Order as Draft` from Shopify, you can use

- **updated\_at\_min** and **~{CreatedDate}~** 
- **status** and **any** 

as key and value respectively combined with the logical **&&** or **\|\|** operator. 
`status` field can take values like `any`, `open` or `completed` depending on the draft otrder status.

>For any other APIs, you should provide the action filter as key-value pair, taking the fields from json structure obtained from the application.
