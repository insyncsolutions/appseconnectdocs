### Creation of Private APP is essential to generate the API Key

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the Shopify Application in the Agent

1. [Create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with Shopify as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2. Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3. Move into the  App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.  

### Steps to Configure Shopify Credential in OP Agent

1. In the App Configuration panel of the agent, click on the + button, beside the app Shopify.

Following this process, the Shopify application can be configured in the OP agent.

Note :
* As per the latest versioning of Shopify API, for validating the Base URL for your Shopify store in APPSeCONNECT Agent, 
  users/implementers need to add `admin/api/2022-01/` as the suffix to the URL .
* This update is available from the On-Premise Agent version 4.4.10.0 & above.
* The adapter version for the Shopify adapter should be 4.2.2.2.

## Cloud Agent Configuration

5. Click on Save and a toaster message will be displayed confirming the same.

## Troubleshooting

Some of the basic troubleshooting issues happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, the processflow do not sync data properly. 
This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system. 
Therefore after clearing all this, you need to [deploy and excute](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow again to perform the required business integration in a smooth and free-flowing way. 
For E.g. If the `Source Application not Found` in the log file appears, remove the Temp and Cache Files. Again re-deploy and execute the processflow. 

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to a particular API endpoint in Shopify, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your shopify installation. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT you need to define Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targetted for a particular 
endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here are the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations.

### Action Filter Implementation 

Data is fetched from source application using APIs, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add these parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 

- General filters : It represents the overall filter criteria of the API. To define such filters, you do not need to specify anything special, just putting the field name and the value with the condition type is fine. 
For example, here we have used created_at_min with a specific value coming from storage to filter data in API.

- In case of retrieving `Customer` from `Shopify` created after a specified date, use `created_at_min` as the key and `~{CreatedDate}~` as its filter. However, customers created before a specified date can also be fetched, by using `created_at_max` as the key and `~{CreatedDate}~` as its filter.
![shopifyapp_1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopifyapp_1.png) 

- Use `status` as the key and `any` as its value, to fetch `A/R Invoice Add` and `Incoming Payment Add` from the source application.
![shopifyapp_2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/shopifyapp_2.png)

- Use `updated_at_min` as the key and `~{CreatedDate}~` as its value, to fetch `Sales Order as Draft` from Shopify.
