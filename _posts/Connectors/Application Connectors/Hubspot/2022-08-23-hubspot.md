`HubSpot` is a `cloud-based CRM` designed to help align sales and marketing teams, foster sales enablement, boost ROI 
and optimize your inbound marketing strategy to generate more, qualified leads. This customer relationship management 
software provides a platform where companies can organize, automate, and keep track of every interaction and 
activity that happens within a company. 

### Benefits of using HubSpot 

- Lead & Contact Conversation Tracking
- Live Chat & Chatbot Workflows
- Visible to all the members of the team
- Customer Satisfaction Surveys
- Provides an interface to use as a Content Management System

As `APPSeCONNECT` is a Business Process Automation tool, this will allow you to develop and configure seamless integration between business applications. 
Therefore, application configuration is a fundamental activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is 
`HubSpot`, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent both in case of `OP` and `Cloud`. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agents for the application `HubSpot`, troubleshooting issues, action and its filters. 

## Pre-requisites for HubSpot Configuration 

1) Create a [developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview) with `HubSpot` by providing necessary credentials.   
2) Create an [app](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-do-i-create-an-app-in-hubspot?_ga=2.148038071.1245514071.1661217523-182514998.1661217523) in HubSpot.  
3) You need to know the [Authentication](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/oauth2/oauth2-overview) and [APIs](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/analytics/reporting#) of the application.   

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the HubSpot Application in OP Agent

1) [Create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with HubSpot as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.  

### Steps to Configure the credentials in OP Agent

1) Open the OP Agent by providing correct login credentials.   
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the HubSpot application. 
The credential panel opens for the application `HubSpot`. 
![hubspotopagent1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/hubspot_opagent1.png) 

3) Enter `Base URL`, `Auth Url`, `Access Token Url`, `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Redirect Url` and `Scope`. 
![hubspotopagent2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/hubspot_opagent2.png)

4) After providing all the required details in the specified fields, click on `Save`. 
A message `Connection saved successfully` will be shown. On clicking `Generate Token` button, you will be 
redirected to the login page of the application. Login with valid credentials and a token will be generated 
through which the request made to the application will be authenticated.  

## Cloud Agent Configuration 

### Configure the HubSpot Application in Cloud Agent

1) Login to `APPSeCONNECT` portal with valid credentials.   

2) Navigate to **Manage > App**. Expand the hubspot application and click on `Credential`. 

3) Expand the `REST` node, click on `Add New Credential`.  

4) Provide the necessary information `Base URL`, `Auth Url`, `Access Token Url`, `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Redirect Url` and `Scope`.  
![hubspot_cloud](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/hubspot_cloud.png)    
 
5) After providing all the required details in the specified fields, click on `Save`. 
A message `Connection saved successfully` will be shown. On clicking `Grant` button, you will be 
redirected to the login page of the application. Login with valid credentials and a token will be generated 
through which the request made to the application will be authenticated. 

## How to get Client ID and Client Secret?

1) Login to `HubSpot` with valid credentials. You will be directed to the `home page`.     
2) On clicking `Apps` on the menu bar, you will be provided with a list of existing `Apps`.      
3) Open any App as per your requirement. On clicking `Auth`, you will be able to view `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.    

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1**

You need to create an app inside `HubSpot` developer account before validating the credential in the agent. 

**ISSUE 2**

While validating the credentials in the agent, sometimes the validation fails due to improper `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. 
Check the credentials once again of the application that you are selecting and re-Validate the credentials. 

### Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to an API in hubspot, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your hubspot application. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need 
to define Schemas and Actions. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here is the 
list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integration.

|Endpoint|Action Name|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Path|
|-----|---|---|------|------|-----|
|Companies|POST|GET|companies/search|Company records store information about a business or organization allowing you to manage this data and sync it between HubSpot and other systems.|[Retrieves company information.](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/companies/get-all-companies)|
|Products|POST|POST|products|Create a new product.|[Product](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/products/create-product)|
|Deals|POST|GET|This will fetch sales order as deals.|Retrives sales order.|[Sales Order](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/deals/get-all-deals)| 
|Contact|POST|POST|companies/search|Create a new contact in HubSpot.|[Contact](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/contacts/create_contact)|

### Action Filter Implementation 

Data is fetched from source application using `APIs`, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the application, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 

- General filters : It represents the overall filter criteria of the API. To define such filters, you do not need to specify anything special, just putting the field name and the value with the condition type is fine.

Let us consider any API of `HubSpot` such as `company`, the request structure will look like : 

```json

  "companies": [
    {
      "portalId": 62515,
      "additionalDomains": [

```
Suppose, you need to fetch several `company` details created before current date with `name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, 
`city` and `country` from `HubSpot`. In case of fetching data from any API of `HubSpot`, you need to use 
`filters` and `sorts` as key in the action filter. However, the value field remains empty for each of the cases. 

Under `filters`, you need to mention the filtering condition as child condition by which request made to the API fetchs the data from `HubSpot`. 
In this scenerio, we will be using `createdate` field as the filter condition. You need to use `propertyName` as the key and 
any field from the json structure returned by the API as value; `operator` is used as the key and value field shall contain 
any symbol depending on the date from which you need to fetch the data. The final parameter is `value` used as the key and 
`~{ReadDateTime('yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ','-48')}~` is used as the value.

![hubspot_actionfilter2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/hubspot_actionfilter2.png)

However, while retrieving the information from `HubSpot` you can specify the order.  To mention the sorting order, use `sorts` 
as the key with the value field remaining blank. Under `sorts`, mention the field name and sorting order as child condition. 
Here, we have used `propertyName` as the key and `createdate` field as the value along with 
`dircetion` and `ASCENDING` as key-value pair to mention the sorting direction. Use `SetPropertiesvalue()` to mention the 
fields that would retrieved from corrosponding API of `HubSpot`. 
Use `properties` and `~{SetPropertiesvalue('createdate~name~email~phone~address~address2~city~country','~')}~` as key-value pair.
