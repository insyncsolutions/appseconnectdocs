- **Built for Better** – An online shopping destination that makes it easy for customers to identify and shop for products that are built better for them. 

Application configuration is an integral activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is Walmart, credentials 
need to be provided for validating the agent. Here you will find the detailed description on how to configure the agents for the application
Walmart, Troubleshooting issues, the attributes and its action. 

## Pre-requisites for Walmart Configuration 

1. Create an account in [Walmart Marketplace](https://developer.walmart.com/home/us-mp/) and complete the registration process. 
2. **Client ID** and **Client Secret** of the application. 
3. [Authorization](https://developer.walmart.com/doc/us/mp/us-mp-authorize/) and [Authentication](https://developer.walmart.com/doc/us/mp/us-mp-auth/) of the application. 

### How to get Client ID and Client Secret? 

1. Click `My Account` to log into the Developer Portal. 
![config_1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/config_1.png)

2. Click `Add New Key For A Solution Provider` to set permissions for the provider to generate a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
![config_2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/config_2.png)

3. Specify specific permissions, or to take the defaults, click **Submit**. The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be generated. 
![config_3](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/config_3.png)

4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to use them in the agent configuration. 

### How to get the Access Token Url?

1. Navigate to [Walmart API](https://developer.walmart.com/api/us/mp/auth#operation/tokenAPI) documentation.   
2. Expand the `Token API`, the `Production URL` will be used as the `Access Token Url`.     

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configuring Walmart Application in OP Agent

1. [Create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with `Walmart` as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2. Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3. Move into the  App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.  

### Steps to Configure Walmart Credential in OP Agent

1. In the App Configuration panel of the agent, click on the + button, beside the app Walmart.  
![walmart_1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/walmart_1.png)     
2. On clicking the + button, the credential panel opens for the application Walmart.   
![walmart_2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/walmart_2.png)
3. Provide `Base URL`, `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Access Token Url` and `Channel Type` in the agent. 
`ChannelType` will be provided by `Walmart` while registering with the application. 
Use `https://marketplace.walmartapis.com/v3/ca/` as Base Url and `https://marketplace.walmartapis.com/v3/token` as Access Token Url. 
The base url will change depending on the country you choose for walmart marketplace. 
4. After providing the credentials, click on `Validate` button. After the validating the credentials successfully, a message 
will be displayed confirming the same. Click on `SAVE` to save the credentials finally.   

Following this process, the `Walmart` application can be configured in the OP agent.

## Troubleshooting

1. Agent validation may fail due to invalid `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Check the credentials 
with the application.    

2. Some of the basic troubleshooting issues happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, and if processflow don't sync properly. 
This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal and from your system. 
Therefore after clearing all this, you need to [deploy and excute](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow again to perform the required business integration in a smooth and free-flowing way. 
For E.g. If the `Source Application not Found` in the log file appears, the probable cause is due to the presence of the 
Temp and Cache Files.  

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to a particular API endpoint in Walmart, you require clear understanding about the data requirements 
and endpoint configurations. You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your Walmart application. 
To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT you need to define Actions and Entities. Actions are specifically targetted for a particular 
endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here are the list of some of the prepackaged API actions defined 
for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integrations. 

|Endpoint|Action|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Help|
|---|-----|---|---|------|-----|
|items|items|GET|items|Displays a list of all items by using either nextCursor or offset and limit query parameters.|[Items](https://developer.walmart.com/tryout/us/mp/items)|
|orders|orders|GET|orders|Retrieves the details of all the orders for specified search criteria.|[Order](https://developer.walmart.com/tryout/us/mp/orders)|
|price|price|PUT|price|Updates the regular price for a given item.|[Price](https://developer.walmart.com/tryout/us/mp/price)|
|inventory|inventory|GET|inventory|You can use this API to get the inventory for a given item.|[Inventory](https://developer.walmart.com/tryout/us/mp/inventory)|

### Action Filter implementation

Data is fetched from source application using APIs, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add these parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 

- General filters : It represents the overall filter criteria of the API. To define such filters, you do not need to specify anything special, just putting the field name and the value with the condition type is fine. 

Let us consider any API of Walmart such as `order`, the request structure will look like : 

```

          "purchaseOrderId": "1796277083022",
          "customerOrderId": "5281956426648",

                        }
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                },
                "orderLineQuantity": {
                  "unitOfMeasurement": "EACH",
                  "amount": "1"
                },
                "statusDate": 1568466647000,
                "orderLineStatuses": {
                  "orderLineStatus": [
                    {
                      "status": "Created",
                      "statusQuantity": {
                        "unitOfMeasurement": "EACH",
                        "amount": "1"
                      }
                    }

                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
```

Suppose you need to fetch 10 orders at a time from `Walmart`, you need to use `limit` as the key and 
in the value field provide any number. With this filtering condition, you can add more filtering condition using the `and` 
clause. In this scenerio, use `createdStartDate` and `~{CreatedDate('yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ',' -6')}~` as key value pair. 
`~{CreatedDate('yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ',' -6')}~` filters data on the basis of the date on which the order is created.
