As `APPSeCONNECT` is a Business Process Automation tool, this will allow you to develop and configure seamless integration between business applications. 
Therefore, application configuration is a fundamental activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is 
`Miva`, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent both in case of `OP` and `Cloud`. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agaents for the application `Miva`, troubleshooting issues, action and its filters. 

## Pre-requisites for Miva Configuration 

1) Create a developer account in [Miva](https://docs.miva.com/developers) with necessary credentials. Everytime, 
you login to `Miva`, you need to pass the `two-factor` authentication.  
2) [Click here](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/#api-endpoint) to know the authentication mechanism and 
different APIs of the application along with their structures.       
3) You need to use the `Endpoint URL` as `https://www.domain.com/mm5/json.mvc` where the domain name will be the 
merchant admin name that has been mailed to you during the registration process. 

### How to generate the Access Token

1) Log in to your `MIVA` application with valid credentials. From dashboard, navigate to `Settings` -> `User Management` -> `API Tokens`. 
Click on `Add API Token`. 
2)Provide a suitable name to your token and `0.0.0.0/0` in `Allowed IP Address`. In `Allowed IP Address`, you 
need to provide the IP addresses to which you want to provide the access. Specify `0.0.0.0/0` to provide access to
any IP address.      
3) The `Endpoint URL` and `Acess Token` will be already be provided in the specified fields. No changes need to be 
done in `Signature` and `Timestamp` fields.

### How to get the Store Code

1) Log in to your `MIVA` application with valid credentials. From dashboard, navigate to `Settings` -> `Store Settings` -> `Store Details` -> `Store Code`.

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the Miva Application in OP Agent

1) [Create a processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with monday as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application. 

### Steps to Configure the credentials in OP Agent

1) Open the OP Agent by providing correct credentials.   
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the application miva. 
The credential panel opens for the application miva. 
![miva_opagent1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/miva_opagent1.png) 

3) Enter `Endpoint Url`, `Access Token` and `Store Code` at the required place. 
![miva_opagent2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/miva_opagent2.png)

4) Click on the “Validate” button, to validate the connection. A message “Test Connection Successful” will appear 
if all the credentials provided by you for miva is valid. After providing all the credentials. Click “Save” button. A message “Connection Data Saved” will appear 
if all the credentials provided by you for `miva` is valid.

Following the above processes, you can configure the miva application in the OP agent. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1 : User Account should be created as Developer in Miva application.** 

You should create an account in miva application as developer user. After creating the account, you should create `API Token` correctly. 

**ISSUE 2 : Agent Validation failed due to improper credential provided in the agent**

While validating the credentials in the agent, sometimes the validation fails due to improper 
`Endpoint URL`, `Access Token` and `Store Code`. Check the credentials once again and re-Validate the credentials. 

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to an API in miva, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of your miva application. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need 
to define Schemas and Actions. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here is the 
list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integration.

You can refer to [miva application](https://docs.miva.com/) to know the [authuorization](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/#auth-token-header) and [APIs](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/functions/customerlist_load_query) in details. 

|Endpoint|Action|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Path|
|---|---|---|---|------|-----|
|Customer|CustomerList_Load_Query|GET|Customer|This function allows you to load a list of customer records from Miva.|[Customer](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/functions/customerlist_load_query)| 
|Order|OrderList_Load_Query|GET|Order|This function is used to query one or more orders from Miva.|[Order](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/functions/orderlist_load_query)|
|Customer|Customer_Insert|POST|Customer|This function allows you to insert a new customer.|[Customer](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/functions/customer_insert)|
|Product|Product_Update|PUT|Product|This function is used to update a product in Miva. The product you want to update can be specified using Product_ID, Product_Code, Edit_Product or Product_SKU.|[Product](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/functions/product_update)| 

## Action Filter Implementation 

Data is fetched from source application using `APIs`, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add any parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 
The parameters are added in the body section of the action filter. We shall look into, how 
you can provide the action filter. 

Let us consider that any user creates several `orders` in miva to maintain and visualize their information. 
The API structure of each such order looks like : 

```
{
	"Store_Code": "beta",
	"Function": "OrderList_Load_Query",
	"Count": "0",
	"Offset": "0",
	"Filter": [
		{
			"name": "search",
			"value": [
				{
					"field": "ship_fname",
					"operator": "EQ",
					"value": "Brennan"
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"name": "ondemandcolumns",
			"value": [
				"payment_module",
				"cust_pw_email",
				"cust_login",
				"ship_method",
				"customer",
				"items",
				"charges",
				"coupons",
				"discounts",
				"payments",
				"payment_data",
				"notes",
				"CustomField_Values:customfields:*"
			]
		}
	],
	"Passphrase": "helloworldhelloworld@123"
}
```

You need to configure the action filter depending on the API structure of the endpoints. [Click here](https://docs.miva.com/json-api/functions/orderlist_load_query) to 
know the action filter of the respective endpoints. In the current scenerio, while you need to fetch order from `miva` application, 
use `count` to specify the number of orders to fectched. From the `API` structure, you could see all the conditions 
has been specified under `Filter`. Similarly, you should use `Filter` as the key and `search` as the key value in action filter 
as the parent conditon. Under this parent condition, use any field any from the `API` strcuture as the filtering the condition. 
Here, we have used `orderdate` as the key with an appropriate value in the value field. 
![mivaactionfilter_1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/mivaactionfilter_1.png) 

Use `Filter` as the key and `ondemandcolumns` as the value to mention the fields that you want to fetch. 
Mention the fields as the child condition of `ondemandcolumns`. Specify `value` as the key and 
the fields(items,customer,payments) as the value.
