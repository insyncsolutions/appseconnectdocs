`Dynamics 365` is the next generation of intelligent business applications that enable your organization to grow, 
evolve and transform. `Dynamics 365` applications unify CRM and ERP capabilities into purpose-built applications 
that work together seamlessly.  

As `APPSeCONNECT` is a Business Process Automation tool, this will allow you to develop and configure seamless integration between business applications. 
Therefore, application configuration is a fundamental activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is 
`Dynamics 365`, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent both in case of `OP` and `Cloud`. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agents for the application `Dynamics 365`, troubleshooting issues and APIs.  

## Pre-requisites for Dynamics 365 Configuration 

1) Register an App in [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com).    
2) Login to [Dynamics 365 CRM](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-in/) using valid credentials.   
3) You need to know the [authentication mechanism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/setup-postman-environment?view=dataverse-latest) and different [APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/entitytypes?view=dataverse-latest&viewFallbackFrom=dynamics-ce-odata-9%3Fview%3Ddynamics-ce-odata-9) of the application along with their structures.    

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the Dynamics 365 CRM Application in OP Agent

1) Create a [processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with `Dynamics 365 CRM` as source application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application. 

### Steps to Configure the credentials in OP Agent

1) Open the OP Agent by providing correct credentials.   
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the application calendly. 
The credential panel opens for the application `Dynamics 365 CRM`.

3) Enter `Company Url`, `Client Id` and `Client Secret` at the required place.

4) Click on the “Validate” button, to validate the connection. A message will appear confirming the same 
if all the credentials provided by you for `Dynamics 365 CRM` is valid. Click “Save” button. 
A message “Connection Saved Successfully!” will appear if all the credentials provided by you for `Dynamics 365 CRM` is valid.

Following the above processes, you can configure the calendly application in the OP agent. 

## Cloud Agent Configuration 

### Configure the Dynamics 365 CRM Application in Cloud Agent

1) Login to `APPSeCONNECT` portal with valid credentials.   

2) Navigate to **Manage > App**. Expand the calendly application and click on `Credential`. 

3) Expand the `REST` node, click on `Add New Credential`.  

4) Provide the necessary information `Credential Name`, `Company Url`, `Client Id` and `Client Secret`.

5) Click on Save and a toaster message will be displayed confirming the same. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1** 

Agent validation may fail due to improper `Personal Access Token` both in `OP` and `Cloud` agent. 
Check the `Personal Access Token` once and re-validate the credentials in the agent. 

**ISSUE 2**

Check whether you have created **triggered processflow** while fetching data from `Calendly`. 
No need to configure the action filter in case of triggered processflow. However, you need to configure the webhook 
by creating a processflow.
