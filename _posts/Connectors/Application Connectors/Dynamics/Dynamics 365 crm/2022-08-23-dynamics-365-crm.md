`Dynamics 365` is the next generation of intelligent business applications that enable your organization to grow, 
evolve and transform. `Dynamics 365` applications unify CRM and ERP capabilities into purpose-built applications 
that work together seamlessly.  

As `APPSeCONNECT` is a Business Process Automation tool, this will allow you to develop and configure seamless integration between business applications. 
Therefore, application configuration is a fundamental activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is 
`Dynamics 365`, credentials need to be provided for validating the agent both in case of `OP` and `Cloud`. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agents for the application `Dynamics 365`, troubleshooting issues and APIs.  

## Pre-requisites for Dynamics 365 Configuration 

1) Register an App in [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com).    
2) Create an account in [Dynamics 365 CRM](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-in/) using necessary credentials.   
3) You need to know the [authentication mechanism](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/setup-postman-environment?view=dataverse-latest) and different [APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/entitytypes?view=dataverse-latest&viewFallbackFrom=dynamics-ce-odata-9%3Fview%3Ddynamics-ce-odata-9) of the application along with their structures.    

### How to register an App in Azure Active Directory?

Executing all the above steps, Dynamics 365 CRM will be successfully configured with the client credentials. 

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration). 

### Configure the Dynamics 365 CRM Application in OP Agent

1) Create a [processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with `Dynamics 365 CRM` as source application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.  
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.  
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application. 

### Steps to Configure the credentials in OP Agent

1) Open the OP Agent by providing correct credentials.   
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the application calendly. 
The credential panel opens for the application `Dynamics 365 CRM`.   
![dynamics365crm1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/dynamics365crm1.png) 

3) Enter `Company Url`, `Client Id` and `Client Secret` at the required place. 
![dynamics365crm2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/dynamics365crm2.png)

4) Click on the “Validate” button, to validate the connection. A message will appear confirming the same 
if all the credentials provided by you for `Dynamics 365 CRM` is valid. Click “Save” button. 
A message “Connection Saved Successfully!” will appear if all the credentials provided by you for `Dynamics 365 CRM` is valid.

Following the above processes, you can configure the `Dynamics 365` application in the OP agent. 

## Cloud Agent Configuration 

### Configure the Dynamics 365 CRM Application in Cloud Agent

1) Login to `APPSeCONNECT` portal with valid credentials.   

2) Navigate to **Manage > App**. Expand Dynamics 365 application and click on `Credential`. 

3) Expand the `REST` node, click on `Add New Credential`.  

4) Provide the necessary information `Credential Name`, `Company Url`, `Client Id` and `Client Secret`.

5) Click on Save and a toaster message will be displayed confirming the same. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1** 

Agent validation may fail due to improper `Personal Access Token` both in `OP` and `Cloud` agent. 
Check the `Personal Access Token` once and re-validate the credentials in the agent. 

**ISSUE 2**

Check whether you have created **triggered processflow** while fetching data from `Calendly`. 
No need to configure the action filter in case of triggered processflow. However, you need to configure the webhook 
by creating a processflow.

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1** 

Agent validation may fail due to improper `Comapny Url`, `Client Id` and `Client Secret` both in `OP` and `Cloud` agent. 
Check the credentials for the above ones and re-validate the credentials in the agent. 

**ISSUE 2**

Some of the basic troubleshooting issues happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated, 
the processflow do not sync data properly. This basic issue resolves after removing the Temp and Cache files from the portal 
and from your system. Therefore after clearing all this, you need to deploy and excute the processflow again to perform the 
required business integration in a smooth and free-flowing way. For E.g. If the Source Application not Found , 
remove the Temp and Cache Files. Again re-deploy and execute the processflow.

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to an API in `Dynamics 365 CRM`, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of `Dynamics 365 CRM` application. To define the endpoint in APPSeCONNECT, you need 
to define Schemas and Actions. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here is the 
list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integration.

|Endpoint|Action|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Path|
|-------|-------|-----|-------|------|-----|
|accounts|accounts|GET|accounts|Represents a customer or potential customer.|-| 
|contacts|contacts|GET|contacts|Represents person with whom a business unit has a relationship.|-|

## Actions Filter Implementation

Data is fetched from source application using `APIs`, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the application, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 

- General filters : It represents the overall filter criteria of the API. To define such filters, you do not need to specify anything special, just putting the field name and the value with the condition type is fine. 

Suppose you need to fetch `leads` from `Dynamics 365 CRM`. While fetching data from `Dynamics 365 CRM`, you need to mention 
`$filter` as the key and value field should be blank. Under `$filter`, mention the field name from the json structure, 
as the filtering condition. In this scenerio, `createdon` as the key and `${lateDate}` as the value have been used. 
To provide the sorting type, specify `orderby` as the key and `createdon asc` as the value.
