`Odoo` is one of the leading `ERP software` for open source, also previously known as `OpenERP`. 
`Odoo` covers a wide range of Apps and modules such as `CRM`, `Sales`, `Development`, 
`Project Management`, `Sales`, `Management of Human Resources` etc. There are different apps 
available based on business verticals that can be installed and used by companies. 
Some apps are available through the Open Source model for free. 
The creation and execution of Odoo enable you to choose from thousands of modules available in the store.    

## Benefits of using Odoo

- **One solution for your entire business** : `Odoo` is a business software suite that can cover all your needs 
in various modules such as `Inventory`, `Sales`, `CRM`, `Accounting`, `Manufacturing`, `Human resources` and many more.    
- **Low cost of implementation** : `Odoo` has a relatively low cost of implementation as well as low recurring costs by providing 
both `Community Version` and `Enterprise Edition`.     
- **Intuitive user interface** : `Odoo` is a user-friendly tool since the main page after logging in shows the different modules 
each user has access to. After selecting one of these modules, users can further navigate by using the navigation bar at the top.
- **Easy to implement** : Since, `Odoo` has a modular structure(sales, accounting, inventory, etc. split into parts or modules), 
it can be implemented in a phased approach one module at a time.
- **Easy integration** : Apart from being customizable, `Odoo` is `API-friendly` and easy to integrate with any other application. 

However, `APPSeCONNECT` is a Business Process Automation tool, this will allow you to develop and configure seamless integration between business applications. 
Therefore, application configuration is a fundamental activity prior to the process of integration. If your chosen application is 
`Odoo`, credentials need to be provided for validating them in `OP` agent. Here you will find the detailed description on 
how to configure the agents for the application `Odoo`, Troubleshooting issues, action and its filters.  

## Pre-requisites for Odoo Configuration 

1) Create an account in [odoo](https://www.odoo.com/web/signup) with necessary credentials.   
2) [Click here](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/api/external_api.html#count-records) to know the authentication mechanism and APIs of the application along with their structures.       
3) Email ID and Password of `Odoo` application to login successfully.          
4) `BaseURL`, `Database Name`, `UserName` and `Password` of the application to validate the credentials in the agent.       

## On-Premise Agent Configuration 

### Installation of On-Premise Agent 

You need to install the agent on your local server. To Know about On-Premise Agent Configuration, [Click here](/deployment/Deployment-Configuration/#on-premise-agent-configuration).    

### How to configure Odoo Application in OP Agent 

1) Create a [processflow](/getting%20started/create-your-first-processflow/) with `Odoo` as source or destination application, and [deploy](/processflow/deploying-and-executing-processflow/) the processflow in On-Premise agent.     
2) Open the agent and click the checkbox in Settings Panel.        
3) Move into the App Configurational Panel of the agent and configure the details of the respective application.         

### Steps to configure the credentials in the OP agent 

1) Open the OP Agent by providing valid credentials.     
2) In the App Configurations panel of the agent, click on the `+` button, beside the application `Odoo`. 
The credential panel opens for the application `Odoo`.       
![odoo1](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/odoo1.png)
3)Provide the `Base Url`, `Database Name`, `User Name` and `Password`.                
![odoo2](/staticfiles/connectors/media/application-connector/odoo2.png)
4) Click on the “Validate” button, to validate the connection. A message `Test Connection Successful` will appear 
if all the credentials provided by you for `Odoo` is valid. After validating the credentials, click “Save” button to save the credetials. 
Following the above processes, you can configure the `Odoo` application in the OP agent. 

## Troubleshooting

**ISSUE 1** 

Some of the basic troubleshooting issue happens due to improper validations or even if it is accurately validated but the 
processflows do not sync the data successfully. This basic issue resolves after removing the `Temp and Cache` files from the 
portal and from your system. Therefore, after clearing the Temp and Cache files, again `deploy and execute` your processflow.  

**ISSUE 2**

User validation may fail due to invaild `Base URL`, `Database Name`, `User Name` and `Password`. 
Check the credentials once again and re-Validate the credentials.                              

## Attributes and Actions

While defining a connection to an API in `Odoo`, you require clear understanding about the data requirements and endpoint configurations. 
You can refer to this document to find all the endpoint details of `Odoo` application. To define the endpoint in `APPSeCONNECT`, you need 
to define Schemas and Actions. Actions are specifically targeted for an endpoint while schema is the data needed to execute the API. Here is the 
list of some of the pre-packaged API actions defined for you which you can easily plug and play while doing your integration.

|Endpoint|Action|Action Type|Schema|UI Help|API Path|
|-----|---|-----|---|------|---|
|/api/product.template/search|product.template|GET|products|Retrieves a number of products.|-| 
|/api/res.users/search|res.users|GET|users|Retrieves a number of users.|-|
|/api/res.users/create|res.users|POST|users|Creates a new in the application.|-|    
|/api/product.template/{{id}}|product.template|PUT|product|Updates contents of the data of the application|-|         

### Action Filter Implementation 

Data is fetched from source application using `APIs`, and as you are aware of, API provides filters 
which will allow you to specify a subset of data from the whole bunch of data created in the server, 
the same can be specified through Actions and Action filters. The Action generally defines the 
endpoint of the application which is being fetched, while the filters define the search criteria 
of the data. You can add any parameters in the `action filter` to define the search criteria. 
The parameters are added in the body section of the action filter. We shall look into, how 
you can provide the action filter. 

Let us consider that any user wants to fetch `registered users` from `Odoo`. You need to know the `API strcuture` of each such endpoints 
to fulfill your request. From the `API` structure, we are using `domain` keyword as the key and mention the `id` of the users in the value field.

However, while fetching `sales order`, you need to use `create_date` as the key, specify any operator(<=,<,>,>=) 
and the date in the value field such as `2020-10-30`.  If you use `<=`, then sales orders created before the mentioned date 
will be retrieved.
